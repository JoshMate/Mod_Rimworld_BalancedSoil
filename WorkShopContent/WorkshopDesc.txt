[h3]Balanced Soil[/h3]

A Vanilla Friendly and Gameplay Balanced way of constructing soil flooring allowing you grow crops anywhere on the map without being too overpowerd, but still giving you the freedom to build nice farms.

No more pesky gravel, sand and stone floor to block your perfectly laid out crop patches.

[h3]Changes[/h3]
- Adds a new floor type "Garden Soil"

[h1]Balance[/h1]
- Requires research: "Tree Sowing"
- Has 120% fertility so Rich Soil (at 140%) still has a purpose .
- Has 250 Work to Build (Same as Paved Tiles).
- Costs 2 Wood to build.
- You get back 0 resources when deconstructing.
- Has all the effects of regular soil (Slowing down movement, Filth, -1 beauty).
- Can be built over everything apart from Water and Mud (Use the Moisture Pump for those).
- Will NOT bloat your Colonies wealth.

[h1]Notes[/h1]
- Highly compatible with other mods as it is just a new .xml Def File.
- Safe to be added or removed from save games at anytime.

[h1]DLC[/h1]
This mod checks what DLCs you have and only changes their content if you have that DLC so you can have none or any combination of DLC Installed.
