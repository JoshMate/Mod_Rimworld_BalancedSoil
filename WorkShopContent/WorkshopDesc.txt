[h3]Balanced Soil[/h3]

A Vanilla Friendly and Gameplay Balanced way of constructing soil flooring allowing you grow crops anywhere on the map.

No more pesky gravel, sand and stone floor to block your perfectly laid out crop patches.

[h3]Changes[/h3]
- Adds a new floor type "Garden Soil"

[h1]Balance[/h1]

- Has 500 Work to Build (Same as Stone Tiles).
- Costs 2 Wood to build.
- You get back 0 resources when deconstructing.
- Has all the effects of regular soil (Slowing down movement, Filth, -1 beauty).
- Can be built over everything apart from Water and Mud (Use the Moisture Pump for those).
